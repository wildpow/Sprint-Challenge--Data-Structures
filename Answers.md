- linked list - 0(n)
- Hash Table - 0(1)
- Binary Search tree - Î˜(log(n))
3. Some of the benifits of using a Hash Tabel over an array in JS are.
    - You can store more complex data structors in a hash table for instance with an array you stuck with numbered indexs for storing and retrival where hash tables keys can be strings and can be accessed by the key name.
    - Retrival is faster with hash tables since you can just use the key name to store and retrive data.
